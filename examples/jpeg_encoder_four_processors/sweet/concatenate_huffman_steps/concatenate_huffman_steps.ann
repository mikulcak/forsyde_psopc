	this one is a bit tricky:
		1. set the first eight words to TOP_INT
		2. set the following word to an integer value between 0 and 256 (since it is the bit position of the content which can never exceed 256)

	the declaration of input is also not set at the entry to the main function but in the for loop body in the main function,
	so every run has different values (this, however, does not change the outcome, is just closer to reality)
